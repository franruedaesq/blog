summary: Diferences between ECMAScript, JavaScript and ECMA-262

## ECMA-262

[ECMA-262](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-intro) **is a Standard** which defines the ECMAScript Language as a base upon which more-robust scripting languages may be built, like Javascript.

## ECMAScript

ECMAScript is a scripting language. A scripting language or script language is a programming language for a runtime system that automates the execution of tasks.

ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript.

ECMAScript is simply a **description of a language implementing all of the facets described in the
ECMAScript Language Specification**. JavaScript implements ECMAScript, but so does Adobe ActionScript.

ECMAScript is not intended to be computationally self-sufficient; Instead, it is expected that the computational environment of an ECMAScript program will provide not only the objects and other facilities described in the ECMA-262 specification but also certain environment-specific host objects, whose description and behaviour are beyond the scope of the ECMA-262 specification.

A web browser provides an **ECMAScript host environment** for client-side computation including, for instance, objects that represent windows, menus, pop-ups, dialog boxes, text areas, anchors, frames, history, cookies, and input/output.

Web browsers are just one host environment in which an ECMAScript implementation may exist. A host environment provides the base implementation of ECMAScript and implementation extensions designed to interface with the environment itself.

Extensions, such as the Document Object Model (DOM), use ECMAScript’s core types and syntax to provide additional functionality that’s more specific to the environment. Other host environments include NodeJS, a server-side JavaScript platform.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

JavaScript is much more than just what is defined in ECMA-262. Indeed, a complete JavaScript implementation is made up of the following three distinct parts:

- **The Core**: ECMAScript, which is defined in ECMA-262 and provides the core functionality.
- **The Document Object Model (DOM)**: which provides methods and interfaces for working with the content of a web page.
- **The Browser Object Model (BOM)**: which provides methods and interfaces for interacting with the browser.

## Conclusion

With the objective of **standardize the Javascript language**, the ECMA Standards were developed, in which the ECMAScript language is defined simply as a description of a language implementing all of the facets described in the specification. ECMAScript specifies the core feature that a scripting language should provide and how those features should be implemented. Javascript is an implementation of the ECMAScript language, but Javascript also has other additional features that are not in the ECMA specifications, like the DOM.
